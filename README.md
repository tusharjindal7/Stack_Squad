Step 1- Word Selection: Use Random module to select a word but keeps it secret from the other players. The word should be of a reasonable length and not too difficult to guess, especially if playing with younger children.

Step 2- Display of Placeholder Letters: The program should print a series of dashes. This represents the unknown letters of the word.

Step 3- Guessing Mechanism: The other players (guessers) take turns guessing letters of the word. They can guess one letter at a time, and typically, guessing non-alphabetic characters or more than one letter at a time is not allowed.

Step 4- Revealing Correct Guesses: If a guesser correctly guesses a letter in the word, the program should replace the letter in the corresponding blank space(s) of the word. If the letter appears multiple times in the word, all instances of it should be revealed.

Step 5- Revealing Incorrect Guesses: If a guesser guesses a letter that is not in the word, the program prints parts of a gallows and hangman. Each incorrect guess results in the addition of another body part to the gallows and the hangman (e.g., head, body, arms, legs). Once the entire hangman is drawn (typically six incorrect guesses), the game ends.

Step 6- End Conditions: The game ends when either: > The guessers correctly guess all the letters in the word, in which case they win. > The hangman is completely printed, indicating that the guessers have run out of guesses, in which case they lose.

Step 7- Outcome Display: Once the game ends, the program reveals the entire word to the guessers. If they successfully guessed all the letters, the program congratulates them on their win. If the hangman is complete, the program reveals the word and commiserates with the guessers on their loss. Step 8- Play Again: Players can choose to play again and the program selects a new word.

There are still some errors in the program.
  1. The hangman pics are being shown in the reverse order.
  2. The last hangman pic is not being shown if all guesses are wrong.
